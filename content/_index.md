# Welcome!
The Tübingen Causality group will host a **Workshop on Causal Representation Learning (CRL 2023)** at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Tübingen from **April 17th to 19th, 2023,** following the CLeaR conference. There is no registration fee. For those who cannot attend in person, the workshop will be broadcasted virtually at this link: TBD.

## About the workshop
This workshop will provide a platform for researchers interested in Causal Represen-tation Learning for sharing and discussing the latest developments in the field. 
The program will feature talks, poster sessions and panel discussions on topics including:

- Learning interventional representations, causal digital twins & structured (causal) world models
- Micro vs. macro/coarse-grained/multi-level causal systems
- Causal discovery and learning (latent) causal bayesian networks and structural causal models
- Identifiable representation learning & nonlinear ICA
- Invariant/multi-environment causal learning
